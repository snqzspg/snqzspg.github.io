### Jekyll Themes
Whenever Snqzs' PG commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in this site, from the content in the Markdown files.

Snqzs' PG site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme that are selected in [repository settings](https://github.com/snqzspg/snqzspg.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
